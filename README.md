# 🧠 Employee Attrition Prediction Using Machine Learning Models

## 📘 Overview
Employee attrition is a significant concern for many organizations, especially in the IT industry. This project uses **Machine Learning (ML)** techniques to predict whether an employee is likely to leave the company based on various features such as **job satisfaction**, **work-life balance**, **monthly income**, and **overtime**.

By applying data preprocessing, feature engineering, balancing techniques (SMOTE), and model comparison, this system identifies high-risk employees — helping HR departments take proactive retention actions.

### Key Steps:
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** — Encoding categorical variables using OneHotEncoder.  
2. **Balancing Dataset** — Using **SMOTE** to handle class imbalance.  
3. **Model Training** — Applying four models:  
   - Logistic Regression  
   - Decision Tree  
   - Random Forest  
   - XGBoost  
4. **Evaluation** — Using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Confusion Matrix.  
5. **Feature Importance Visualization** — Determining top factors influencing attrition.
